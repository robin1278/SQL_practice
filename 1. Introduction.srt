00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,680
Hi, and welcome to the SQL Masterclass course, where you will learn how to manage your data and how

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,370
to perform analysis on your data using SQL.

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,830
My name is Abhishek and along with my co instructor Poco Raj, I will be leading you through this course

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,420
as instructors.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,310
Our courses have been enrolled by over a million students worldwide.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,800
We both hold engineering and MBA degrees and have previous work experience of data analytics and consulting

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,430
industry.

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,880
While doing our jobs, we realized that businesses today are moving from traditional intuition based

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,600
decision making to data driven decision making.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,220
Therefore, the use of SQL is now no longer limited to developers or programmers.

11
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:03,150
Even business managers, analysts and marketing researchers need to learn this language.

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,270
We have designed this course for individuals who wish to build a career in these fields and learn a

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
skill from the basic to the advanced level.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:23,450
If you put one hour a day regularly within two weeks, you will be able to fetch any kind of data and

15
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,720
analyze the data using SQL based commands.

16
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:35,330
We will start this course by setting up PostgreSQL and PKG admin in your system so that you can practice

17
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,140
side by side.

18
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:43,490
We have selected PostgreSQL because most big companies in the field of analytics are using PostgreSQL.

19
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,260
But do not worry.

20
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:53,570
Even if you are working on any other dialect such as my SQL or Microsoft SQL, almost all the queries

21
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,490
have similar syntax.

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,830
I will also discuss a case study in the beginning of the course to demonstrate how a skill is used to

23
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,870
answer business questions.

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,060
Then we will take our first steps into a school and learn how to create a database, create tables in

25
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,470
a database, and then add data into those tables.

26
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:27,740
Next, we will learn some fundamental commands of SQL, which will enable us to query that is, retrieve

27
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,690
the data from a database.

28
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,690
We often want the data to be processed and to contain some information.

29
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:43,010
For this, we will learn how to filter and sort the data so that we retrieve only relevant information

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,860
and that to in the order we like.

31
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:54,200
After that, we will learn how to group data and find out aggregate values such as sum and count.

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:03,760
Then we will cover some advanced and important topics such as joints, subcommittees, views and indexes.

33
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:13,630
Next, we cover in different sections the different types of functions such as string functions, mathematical

34
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,940
datetime, and window functions.

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,590
Apart from this, at the end of the course, we have included some best practices and performance tuning

36
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,540
techniques for storing and retrieving the data in the most efficient way.

37
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,170
Lastly, we have also added some 30 lectures covering some important topics which are often asked in

38
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,050
interviews so that you can track the interviews for the job that you always wished for.

39
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:49,120
The ideal student for this course is a fresh graduate looking for a job as an analyst or a programmer

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,520
or a working professional who wants to explore or expand their skill set.

41
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,880
There are no prerequisites for this course.

42
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,840
We will teach you everything from basic to advanced level.

43
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,970
We only ask that you do practical exercises side by side.

44
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,290
If you have any doubt or query throughout the course, you can post them in the discussion forum.

45
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:21,430
We will be solving all your doors, so feel free to have a look at the course description and we look

46
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,050
forward to seeing you inside.
